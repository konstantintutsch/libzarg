## Code

You want to directly contribute to this project? Great! Open a pull request via [GitHub](https://github.com/konstantintutsch/zarg) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/konstantintutsch/zarg).

But before you commit your code, run GNU indent on it. You can use the `format` make rule if you've edited an already existing file.

```
make format
```

If you've added a new file, run GNU indent manually.

```
indent file.c -linux -nut -i4
```
